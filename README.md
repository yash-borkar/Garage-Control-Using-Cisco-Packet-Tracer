## 💡 Motivation
- To reduce internal garage temperature by opening doors when CO₂ emissions exceed a defined threshold.
- Enable interaction among IoT devices based on user-defined conditions.
- Provide remote monitoring via an IP camera to minimize the need for physical checks.
- Automate lighting to enhance energy efficiency and reduce power consumption.
- Create a secure and smart system to simplify daily tasks.

## ⭐ Features
- 🔄 Automatic opening and closing of doors and windows based on environmental conditions.
- 🌬️ Monitoring of CO₂ levels and temperature, triggering actions as needed.
- 📹 IP camera integration for remote viewing of the garage.
- 💡 Scheduling of lights to turn on and off automatically.
- 🔒 Secure access control via username and password authentication.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Simulation Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Hardware:** Smart sensors, actuators, IP camera
- **Programming:** Microcontroller (MCU) for device control

## 📋 Implementation Methodology
1. **Setup Environment**: Use Cisco Packet Tracer to create a virtual environment for the smart garage system.
2. **Connect Devices**: Utilize Fast Ethernet cables to connect smart objects to a central switch, which connects to the server and PC.
3. **Define Conditions**: Program smart objects with specific conditions based on user requirements for automation and control.
4. **Secure Access**: Implement a pin lock system for mobile devices to ensure secure access to smart objects.

## 📥 Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yash-borkar/Garage-Control-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer.git
   cd Garage-Control-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
2. Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Import the provided Packet Tracer file to start the simulation.

## ⚙️ Usage
- After setting up the environment, use the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation to interact with the smart garage system.
- Monitor CO₂ and temperature levels, which will automatically trigger the opening of doors and activate sprinklers if thresholds are exceeded.
- Control lights and view the garage remotely through the integrated IP camera.

## 🎯 Expected Results
- 🚪 The system opens garage doors and windows when CO₂ emissions exceed the user-defined threshold.
- 💧 The ceiling sprinkler activates in response to high temperature and smoke levels.
- 🚨 An alarm is triggered in case of fire-related incidents.
- 🔐 Users can securely authenticate to control smart devices via a mobile application.
